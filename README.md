# Komputer Store - A dynamic Webpage using JS

## Project Description
This project was an assignment at Experis Academy. The goal was to build a dynamic webpage using "vanila" JavaScript. 
The webpage needed to have the following: 
* The Bank – an area where you will store funds and make bank loans
* Work – an area to increase your earnings and deposit cash into your bank balance
* Laptops – an area to select and display information about the merchandise

Further detailed instruction on how the areas should function were also given. As an example, if one had a loan 10% of the earninga should go towards loan payment when salary was transfered from work to bank.

### Challenges and future improvments
Before this project I hadn't worked much with frontend, so I challanged myself to create a fun design and not use the given example wire frame. I struggled a bit with css but eventually manage to create an decent webdesign. It stil has some allign and rescaling problems.
As for now the project only has one JavaScript file, I probably should have used modules and divide into smaller JavaScript file to get a better structure.
