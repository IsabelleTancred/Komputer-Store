# Komputer Store - A dynamic Webpage using JS

## Project Description
This project was an assignment at Experis Academy. The goal was to build a dynamic webpage using "vanila" JavaScript. 
The webpage needed to have the following: 
* The Bank – an area where you will store funds and make bank loans
* Work – an area to increase your earnings and deposit cash into your bank balance
* Laptops – an area to select and display information about the merchandise

The area works as follows.
**Bank** - Shows your balance. Gives you the option to take a loan. However you can only have one loan and you can't borrow more than twice of your balance. If you have a loan, bank will show your debt.
**Work** - Work shows your salary. Each time work button is presses you earn 100. The transfer button moves your current salary to the bank. If you have a loan 10% is used to pay loan, rest is moved to balance. You also have the option to pay of the loan with all of your earnings by using the "pay loan" button.
**Laptops** - Here you can find information about different computers. The select menu have several different computers and by selecting a new computer in the select menu, information about the selected computer will be shown. If you have enough balance, you can buy the computer.

### Challenges and future improvments
Before this project I hadn't done much frontend, so I challanged myself to create a fun design and not use the given example wire frame. I struggled a bit with css but eventually managed to create a decent webdesign. It stil has some allign and rescaling problems, however given the time-limit and requirements of the project I didn't focus to much on improving those parts.
As for now, the project only has one JavaScript file, I probably should have used modules and divide the big JS-file into smaller JS-files to achieve a better structure.
